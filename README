NAME
    Authen::NTLM - Perl extension for NTLM related computations

SYNOPSIS
    use Authen::NTLM qw(nt_resp lm_resp);

        $my_pass = "mypassword";
        $nt_resp = nt_resp($my_pass, $nonce);
        $lm_resp = lm_resp($my_pass, $nonce);

DESCRIPTION
    The NTLM (Windows NT LAN Manager) authentication scheme is the
    authentication algorithm used by Microsoft.

    NTLM authentication scheme is used in DCOM and HTTP environment. It is
    used to authenticate DCE RPC packets in DCOM. It is also used to
    authenticate HTTP packets to MS Web Proxy or MS Web Server.

    Currently, it is the authentication scheme Internet Explorer chooses to
    authenticate itself to proxies/web servers that supports NTLM.

    As of this version, NTLM module only provides the client side functions
    to calculate NT response and LM response. The next revision will provide
    the server side functions that computes the nonce and verify the NTLM
    responses.

    This module was written without the knowledge of Mark Bush's (MARKBUSH)
    NTLM implementation. It was used by Yee Man Chan to implement a Perl
    DCOM client.

DEPENDENCIES
    To use this module, please install the one of the following two sets of
    DES and MD4 modules:

    1) Crypt::DES module by Dave Paris (DPARIS) and Digest::MD4 module by
    Mike McCauley (MIKEM) first. These two modules are implemented in C.

    2) Crypt::DES_PP module by Guido Flohr (GUIDO) and Digest::Perl::MD4
    module by Ted Anderson (OTAKA). These two modules are implemented in
    Perl.

    The first set of modules will be preferred by NTLM because they are
    supposedly faster.

TO-DO
    1) A function to compose NTLM negotiation packet for DCE RPC.

    2) A function to compute nonce at the server side.

    3) A function to compose NTLM chanllenge packet for DCE RPC.

    4) A function to compose NTLM response packet for DCE RPC.

    5) Implement the module in C.

BUGS
    Nothing known.
